Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. “Cookies” and local storage are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer’s browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Many major websites use cookies to provide useful features for their users. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of our Site. Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the following purposes: <strong>Type of Cookie Purpose of Cookie</strong> Analytics and Performance Cookies Analytics and Performance Cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services. The information gathered does not identify you or any other individual visitor. The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages that they visited on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before and other similar anonymous, aggregated information. We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services. We use Google Analytics for this purpose, which uses its own cookies. This information is used only to improve how our Services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a>.

For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load more quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services. Functionality Cookies Functionality cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, for example remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in (and in some cases to show you poll results) and remembering changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services. Social Media Cookies Social media cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this. Targeted and advertising cookies Targeted and advertising cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements that may be relevant to your interests while you are on third-party websites. These cookies also store your location, including your latitude, longitude, and Geo IP region ID, which helps us show you locale-specific news and allows our Services to operate more efficiently. You can disable cookies that remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting<a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://youradchoices.com/control</a>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed. <strong>Flash</strong> A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that is built into or downloaded by you onto your device. Flash cookies are used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.

If you choose to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device some features of the Site may not function properly. <strong>Pixel Tags</strong> We also use “pixel tags,” which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Site and collect information. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer. We use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our Site and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Site or other websites. In addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes. If you opt out of these technologies, you will continue to see advertising displayed on the Site, but the advertising may not be targeted to your interests. Please remember that we do not have access to, or control over, advertisers’ or service providers’ cookies, and the information practices of third parties are not covered by this privacy policy. For more information on the use of cookies in online advertising, please see the section on third-party online advertising and visit the NAI’s website .<strong>Do Not Track</strong> We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
