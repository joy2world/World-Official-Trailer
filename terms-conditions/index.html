To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>



<p>Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Company, its subsidiaries, and its licensors do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the service will meet your requirements; that the service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the service is free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

<ol start="3"><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></li></ol>



<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Company, its affiliates, directors, employees or its licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, that result from the use of, or inability to use, this service. Under no circumstances will Company be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the service or your account or the information contained therein.</p>



<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Company assumes no liability or responsibility for any:</p>



<ol>

<p>This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>



<p>The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. Company makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with local law, including but not limited to export and import regulations.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Use of Our Service</strong></li></ol>

<li>You will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>
</ol>



<p>You do not have to register in order to use the Service. To access certain features of the Service, though, you will need to register with Company and create a “Member” account or profile.

<p>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc. , that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser, and you agree not to aggregate or collate any of the content available through the Service for use elsewhere. You also agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account or profile names, from the Service nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes.</p>

</ol>



<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>
